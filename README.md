### Scenario

*You’re onboarding a new dev who swears by XML. To show them the glory of Jetpack Compose, you promise to recreate a simple birthday invite screen "without even opening a layout file." Now the pressure’s on — you need a clean layout that looks great.*

### Feature Goal
- Build a static birthday invite screen using only Jetpack Compose layout elements.
